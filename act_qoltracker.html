                                We believe effective Financial Planning is all about maximising your ongoing quality of life by supporting you in managing both your tangible financial and less tangible personal assets and liabilities.

                                <br />
                                We consider quality-of-life is not necessarily determined by how much money you have but rather how and how you invest and use it to meet your most important needs and goals.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Accordingly we will strive to listen and understand your special wishes, worries, hopes and fears, starting with your most pressing jobs to be done.

                                <br />
                                So, before we start working through a detailed description of your situation and needs, we would like to offer you the opportunity of using a Quality-of Life Tracker to set a benchmark as to how satisfied you are with your current quality-of-life.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                This tool helps us explore some of the key pillars of your quality of life including your health and mindset, your connection to others, your confidence in dealing with life’s challenges, your sense of purpose and meaning as well as your overall life satisfaction.
                                <br />

                                <br />
                                OK let’s get started. Generally, The QOL Tracker takes about 10 minutes to complete and then we can score and discuss the results. As mentioned in our Financial Services Guide all your information and results belong to you and are held in a secure file.”

                                Firstly, let’s work through some questions on how you feel about your personal health, including your emotional well-being. Before we get started just take a moment to consider how you have been feeling over the last few weeks overall. Have you generally been 'feeling good' about your life?
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Ok so for the first question. How frequently have you been feeling active with plenty of energy these days”, from ‘Always’, to ‘Often’, ‘Sometimes’, ‘Rarely’ or ‘Never’?
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The next question focuses on how well you feel you have coped with any health issues you may have recently encountered. Would you say you are coping very well ‘Always’, ‘Often’, ‘Sometimes’, ‘Rarely’ or ‘Never’? (If you’ve had no health issues assume your general preventative strategies have worked and rate yourself a 10.)
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The third question in this Personal Health-related cluster focuses on how frequently you typically feel positive and optimistic about your life – Would you say ‘Always’, ‘Often’, ‘Sometimes’, ‘Rarely’ or ‘Never’?
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The final personal health question provides an opportunity for you to reflect on the degree to which you have been using your time and energy day to day on what is most important to you. Take a moment to consider this in recent weeks. Would you say ‘Always’, ‘Often’, ‘Sometimes’, ‘Rarely’ or ‘Never’?

                                                Working, especially with new clients, provides a great opportunity for you to get a deeper glimpse into their lives and a sense of their particular needs and sensitivities going forward. It can also be a great trust building activity.

                                                Firstly, to initially park your problem solving (convergent mindset ie:-what are the likely best solutions?) to one side and just focus and observe (divergent- open discovery mindset) how they go about the process of considering and answering the QOL Tracker Questions. What body language do they display which may reveal their deeper thoughts or how they might be feeling.
                                                <br />
                                                <br />
                                                Are they more introverted (need time to think and reflect before answering each question) or extraverted and tend to go into long explanations about their various ailments before rating their overall personal health?
                                                <br />
                                                <br />
                                                Do you get any insights as to their sensory/learning preferences, eg:- Visual (like to see graphs, spread sheets, diagrams, reading reports etc), Auditory  (learn through hearing case histories, stories, or discussing their own experiences) and Kinaesthetic (develop understanding by doing surveys, demonstrating, experimenting etc).
                                                <br />
                                                <br />
                                                By picking client’s sensory preferences you can then use them to aid their decision making. For example, more introverted clients with visual sensory preferences may need to take written reports with graphs and diagrams away in order to think through their options before coming back with a decision.
                                                <br />
                                                <br />
                                                How can you best frame open questions (that avoid yes/no answers) to help them reflect more deeply on their experiences and feelings?
                                                <br />
                                                <br />
                                                How can you resist listening to reply rather than listening to understand?
                                                <br />
                                                <br />
                                                And most significantly how can you show them you have heard what they are saying and feeling by reflecting what you have picked up? This can be done by summarising in your own words (not parroting).
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>What they are saying or have said “So what I understand caused the mistake was……”</li>
                                                    <li>How they are feeling “I’m picking up that the incident you described made you feel pretty alarmed”</li>
                                                    <li>And then Empathising (not sympathising) “If that happened to me, I would also feel pretty let-down if …</li>

                                                </ul>
                                                When clients become emotional and upset, often the best way of responding is to let them know you understand what happened and exactly how they are feeling, by summarising what you’ve heard in your own words. That is often all they require before starting to work out what they need to do next. A common difficulty we all have as professional ‘problem solvers’ is that we often jump in far too quickly with solutions when it may be more appropriate to coach them to come up with their own solutions.

            How do you feel about your assessment of your current Quality-of-Life? Do any of your responses to individual questions highlight any particular successes or achievements you have secured over the last few weeks or triggered any particular underlying concerns or anxieties which you may now need to address?
            <br />
            <br />
            Looking forward, what specific QOL dimensions/issues would you like to work on during the ongoing financial planning process relating to:-
            <ul>
                <li>Personal health, fitness and resilience</li>
                <li>Connection with family friends and others</li>
                <li>Capability to get things done and/or resolve issues and</li>
                <li>Having a greater sense of purpose and meaning</li>
            </ul>
            NB I will encourage you to redo the QOL Tracker at various points throughout our time working together to measure your overall progress and to identify any events and issues that may have impacted your QOL.
            <br />
            <br />
            “In maintaining your QOL over time, you will need to take advantage of opportunities that present themselves as well as successfully adapting to the inevitable and unexpected shocks and events (eg covid) that will impact your life. Also, the internal changes that arise from the inevitable process of aging (eg eyesight deterioration, hearing loss and mobility difficulties).
            <br />
            <br />
            “We see as part of our job to help you anticipate these changes and to adapt where possible, turning threats into opportunities. In fact, what we find with other clients is that having a practical financial plan provides people with confidence in their ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Plans can sort of be an anchor when unexpected change arises and can be adapted accordingly. However, with no plans there is often a scramble to adapt. Contingencies can also be built into plans.”

    <h5>Scoring technical notes</h5>
    <p>
        Score components as below, with a total average across all.
        <ul>
            <li>Never = 0</li>
            <li>Rarely = 1</li>
            <li>Sometimes = 4</li>
            <li>Often = 7 </li>
            <li>Always = 10</li>
        </ul>
        Then average this with Overall life satisfaction for final score out of 10.
        <br />
        <br />
        This builds in natural weighting of the scores i.e.
        <ul>
            <li>Personal Health* = 25%</li>
            <li>Connection = 13%</li>
            <li>Capability = 6%</li>
            <li>Purpose = 6% </li>
            <li>Life Satisfaction = 50%</li>
            <li><b>Total = 100%</b></li>
        </ul>

        Add up your rating for each question using the above values and divide the total by 8 to get an overall average.
        <br />
        <br />
        Then to this average add your Life satisfaction score (0 - 10 ) and finally divide this total by 2 to arrive at your current Quality-of-Life Score of between 0-10.

        <br />
        <br />
        Financial Planners need to be not only good technical financial planners but also ‘aware and sensitive’ change facilitators. As the saying goes ‘change is exciting when we initiate it but threatening when done to us’.
        <br />
        <br />
        Typical aging processes bring a range of tangible and intangible body changes. Many of these are perceived as threats/losses, such as deteriorating eyesight, hearing difficulties, worn-out joints and cognitive functioning e.g. in short-term memory. All need to be adapted to or compensated for. This is where Financial Planners need to demonstrate high levels of empathy and effective change facilitation skills, as well as the ability to build likely financial impacts (e.g. expensive support needs) into staged financial plans.
