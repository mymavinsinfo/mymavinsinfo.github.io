                <p>
                    The pension versus lump sum decision faced by members of defined benefits schemes is a complex one.  Members are required to balance their short-term and long-term risks, goals and responsibilities all within a context of uncertainty.

                    As human beings we naturally employ various strategies to help with our financial decisions.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In this study we access credible secondary research in the fields of behavioural economics and psychology in order to apply a real-world behavioural lens to the pension versus lump sum decision. In the process we distil:

                        <li>That authentic happiness and life satisfaction instead come from feeling in control, connected with community, and the ability to live with purpose in accordance with our values.</li>

                <p>
                    ASIC has identified that good quality advice refines and clarifies a client’s objectives, and helps the client, as much as possible, to achieve those objectives.
                    <br /><br />Consistent with this, advisers have an ethical responsibility to provide their services with diligence.  According to the FASEA Code of Ethics, this requires that advisers exercise due care and skill in the way they understand each client; diagnose each client’s needs and issues; and ensure the strategy recommended is intended to improve the client’s financial wellbeing.
                    <br /><br />This requires an adviser to consider the drivers of financial wellbeing and broader aspects of wellbeing, which involves more than money.

                <p>
                    Australians worry about money regardless of their wealth. People who are financially stressed drink more, sleep less, and have more conflict in their personal relationships.  This negatively impacts on their mental health. As their mental health deteriorates, they feel more financially stressed. Left unaddressed, it can become a vicious cycle.
                    <br /><br />Anxiety about our short-term financial commitments is at the core of financial stress. Well-paid professionals earning salaries are not immune to financial stress.
                    <br /><br />For example, Commonwealth public servants receive fortnightly salaries over the course of their careers. From this salary many are required to cover a mortgage, raise and educate their families and cope with unexpected life events. As they approach retirement, it is perfectly rational for retiring public servants to want some greater sense of freedom from the fortnightly cycle of ‘keeping up’.
                    <br /><br />In this way, the lump sum represents freedom to meet lump sum commitments during the active years of retirement.

                <p>
                    Ultimately human beings want to maximise their happiness, both now and in the future.
                    <br /><br />Hedonic happiness is achieved through pleasure and the absence of discomfort and is experienced ‘in the now’. Eudemonic happiness is achieved through satisfaction with life including perceptions of achievement, meaning, purpose and contentment. i.e. an assessment reflected on later.
                    <br /><br />Both are important to achieving wellbeing and life satisfaction.
                    <br /><br />We know that the role of an adviser is to enable the client to make financial decisions that help achieve their goals and improve their financial wellbeing.  In practice, that means helping the client make decisions that enhance both short-term and long-term happiness.

                <p>
                    The correlation between wealth and subjective wellbeing is strong for the poor, but it reduces considerably for the mass affluent and flattens out for the HNW. While lack of money will bring misery, past a point there are diminishing returns in its capacity to buy happiness.
                    <br /><br />A ground-breaking study by Richard Easterlin first formulated in the 1970s, but revisited in 2014, showed that over a seven-decade period, the trend in United States happiness has been slightly negative despite real incomes more than tripling. Another landmark study by Deaton and Kahneman more recently demonstrated that while poverty will breed misery, money only buys happiness to a point. Past this point (typically lower ranks of the mass affluent) the improvements to wellbeing that greater income provides begin to diminish rapidly. Furthermore while the more affluent may prove to have greater overall life satisfaction, they may not necessarily be emotionally happy on a day to day basis. In fact relative expectations can engender even greater levels of financial stress among wealthier echelons of our society.
                    <br /><br />Clearly, there is more than money at play here and if advisers are to display diligence in their professional practices, they need to do more than just increase wealth in order to enhance financial wellbeing.

                <p>
                    The sense of feeling in control in your retirement is both a great source of joy and conversely in its absence a potential source for stress and misery. Regardless of circumstances retirees will always be fundamentally happier when they feel in control and not plagued by uncertainties about the future.
                    <br /><br />Exchanging a non-indexed pension for a lump sum capital amount provides the investor with control.   Control over how the money is invested, control over accessibility, control over how it is spent, whether on capital purchases like a holiday, new car or kitchen renovations.
                    <br /><br />In the absence of ready access to capital, clients will be reliant on saving from their pension payments.  Not having ready access to money is a major cause of financial stress.

                <p>
                    Relationships and quality connection, whether they be with partners, family, friends, and communities are fundamental to our wellbeing.
                    <br /><br />The most comprehensive study of happiness conducted by Harvard happiness for over 75 years has some very clear conclusions - good relationships keep us happy and healthy. It’s the quality of close relationships rather than the quantity. It often about coping too – those in good relationships report less impact on happiness when experiencing pain, sickness or loss. Those who are lonely amplify their physical pain with emotional pain.
                    <br /><br />In the active years of retirement, retirees typically share experiences with friends and family.  Whether it be travelling around Australia towing a caravan with friends or taking the grandchildren to Disneyland, access to capital during retirement allows us to stay connected.

                <h2>1.7	Humans have ways of coping with complex decisions</h2>
                <p>
                    It is impossible for a pre-retiree to make an informed decision about their retirement. There’s just so much uncertainty and they have no experience with the lifestyle.  Retirement is long, and we don’t know what challenges we will face along the way.  As we age, we want to grow old with dignity, and have flexibility and options with the aged care and health systems.
                    <br /><br />But human beings have ways of coping with complex decisions when they don’t have all the information. We use mental shortcuts, or heuristics, to make decisions. When faced with choices along a continuum, we seek to avoid the extreme ends. For example, when faced with the choice of pension versus lump sum in a defined benefit scheme, we typically choose a combination. It’s also why most investors categorise themselves as balanced investors.
                    <br /><br />Anchoring or framing also plays an important part in decision making. The positioning of a decision matters. And therefore a super fund’s communication matters. Where defined benefit schemes communicate in their periodic members statements lump sum capital projections, members are more likely to prefer a lump sum. It makes sense, because any lump sum exchanged for a pension is perceived as a loss and retirees are more loss averse than younger investors.
                    <br /><br />Hyperbolic discounting plays a part as well.  As human beings we have difficulty picturing ourselves in the future. We value benefits today more highly than a promise of future benefits.

                <p>
                    Human beings have no innate sense of discipline. Any self-disciplined behaviour is learned from the environment.  It’s why we have so many regrets when it comes to our finances. All of us haven’t done things that we intended to do and we have done things we had no intention of doing. It’s what author Carl Richards calls ‘the behaviour gap’.
                    <br /><br />We know that we should save our excess cashflow and allocate it to investments, but most of us either don’t or we do so in an inefficient manner.  That’s why there is a real risk that if a retiree chooses a pension level above their day-to-day needs, that the excess will be unwittingly wasted and not contribute to the achievement of lifestyle objectives or financial wellbeing.

                <p>
                    Quality of life as measured by wellbeing is a multifaceted concept where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. The critical building blocks complement or undermine each other in a holistic way. The close interrelationship between these factors means that an effective promotion of wellbeing needs to address all of these issues and not just one in isolation.
                    <br /><br />Financial wellbeing sits both at the crux of the reality we experience and our perceptions of our life experience. It’s important to consider that financial wellbeing has both objective and subjective aspects i.e. there is a relative experience of financial wellbeing that transcends absolute wealth. This is your financial confidence – security you can maintain what you have (keep enjoying what you now do), reach your goals in the future (achieve your ‘expected’ aspirations) and navigate uncertain future risks (peace of mind you don’t have to worry now). This can look quite different depending on your expectations in life and current circumstance reference point.

                    The inexorable connection between mental and physical health has long been established.6 Stress and unhappiness can contribute to poor health and vice a versa, meaning that each cannot be effectively addressed without considering the other. Positive physical and mental health outcomes from these efforts also save governments billions of dollars in health care costs.2 4
                    <br /><br />The evidence suggests that better physical and mental health improve decision making particularly around financial matters. This leads to enhanced financial outcomes, facilitating financial security and independence. 12 13 14 15 16
                    <br /><br />Financial issues (49%) and family issues (45%) remain the leading causes of stress amongst Australians and this is no coincidence as one can beget the other.12 Other significant causes of stress notably include12:

                        <li>Personal health issues (42%)</li>
                        <li>Issues with trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle (39%)</li>
                        <li>Issues with the health of close ones (36%)</li>
                        <li>Issues in the workplace (32%)</li>
                        <li>Relationship issues (31%)</li>

                    </ul>

                    While family issues and issues related to personal finance remain the leading sources of stress for women, the leading source of stress for men are issues related to personal finance. Financial stress can have major affects on your health. Stress, in general, can cause heart attacks, strokes and many other serious health issues.12 Studies have found that 79% of people with debt lose considerable amounts of sleep, with 74% of those saying that it affects their mental health. Many studies have also found that a cross section of society are in some way worried about their finances whether in debt or not.14
                    <br /><br />Furthermore lack of financial wellbeing is associated with low levels of engagement and reduced productivity at work. Coupled with physical and mental wellbeing, these factors account for the lion share of Australia’s estimated economic costs from absenteeism ($7 billion per year.1), presenteeism ($26 billion per year.2) and turnover. Not to mention the extreme public economic burden that inevitably results from poor financial, mental and physical wellbeing among the population.

                <h2>2.1.2 The experience of financial stress</h2>
                <p>
                    Financial stress is not just poverty - it’s also about ‘missing out’ on quality of life. The long established and Government cited ABS framework for financial stress indicators is broken up into two categories: ‘Financial stress experiences’ and ‘Missing out experiences’. This framework is primarily objective in nature rather than subjective but it notably integrates implied ‘quality of life needs’ that go beyond basic financial security measures. The Financial Stress Experiences component covers the basic needs such as;
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ability to raise $2000 in a week for something important</li>
                        <li>Spending more money than received, having to borrow money or seek assistance</li>
                        <li>Went without meals or unable to heat home</li>

                    </ul>
                    The Missing Out Experiences component taps into some key lifestyle quality factors that are obviously somewhat relative to personal expectations i.e. what does a special meal, new clothes or suitable holiday look like for the individual. The factors included in the financial stress index include;
                    <ul>
                        <li>Could not afford holiday for at least one week a year</li>
                        <li>Could not afford a night out once a fortnight</li>
                        <li>Could not afford friends or family over for a meal once a month</li>
                        <li>Could not afford special meal once a week</li>
                        <li>Could only afford second hand clothes most of the time</li>
                        <li>Could not afford leisure or hobby activities</li>

                <h2>2.1.3 Financial stress and wellbeing can be independent of absolute wealth</h2>
                <p>
                    It has long been found that within a country at a given time those with higher incomes do tend to be happier. However, this is largely driven by relative perceptions and expectations. Subjective assessments of wellbeing shift in accordance with the actual income of the society.
                    <br /><br />While a lack of money and confidence in your financial security is associated with poor wellbeing, the correlation between wealth and happiness only holds to a point. Past this there are diminishing returns for day to day emotional wellbeing although life satisfaction does improve.
                    <br /><br />There is no absolute sum of money that makes everyone feel financially secure and free of financial stress. Rather it depends on who you are comparing yourself to, the expectations you have, and how secure you feel in keeping what you have. Financial stress is subjective and largely about the way you see things relative to your expectations in life. It is moderated by a greater sense of control and certainty in the future.  In fact it is not uncommon to see a dip in subjective wellbeing and increase in financial stress in relatively wealthier groups who don’t quite feel secure they have ‘made it’ yet. We often see affluent Australians feel less prepared for retirement than many in the mass market because they have much greater expectations of the retirement savings they will require.

                <h2>2.1.4 Holistic wellbeing requires a balance of both short term and long term needs</h2>
                <p>
                    Another critical phenomenon is the divergence between day to day happiness and overall life satisfaction. Day to day happiness is achieved through pleasure and the absence of discomfort and is experienced ‘in the now’. Satisfaction with life includes perceptions of achievement, meaning, purpose and contentment i.e. an assessment reflected on ‘then’. Both are important to holistic wellbeing but they can disconnect. You might pursue the things that make you happy day to day but neglect to take care of your future happiness or overall life satisfaction. You might be highly satisfied with your overall life achievements but yet not planned for the day to day life that you will be truly happy leading. On average, material progress has some tendency to help people get what they want in life, while relationships and engaging activities are more important for people’s emotional lives and holistic wellbeing.
                    <br /><br />The famous study by Kahneman and Deaton cited above analyzed more than 450,000 responses to the Gallup-Healthways Wellbeing Index (GHWBI), a daily survey that asks a battery of questions about wellbeing. It concluded that happiness is actually the result of the fulfilment of two abstract psychological states -- emotional wellbeing and life evaluation. Life evaluation requires a long view of a person's overall life. Though coloured by the day's emotions, it is based on a retrospective of their achievements. If they've accomplished the goals they've set, are financially secure, and are emotionally fulfilled, they're more likely to have a high evaluation of their life. Having goals that you can meet is essential to life satisfaction while setting goals that you're not going to meet sets you up for failure.
                    <br /><br />Emotional wellbeing reflects the emotional quality of an individual's everyday experience which is heavily influenced by social connection. In the words of Dr Kahneman “Emotional happiness is primarily social. The very best thing that can happen to people is to spend time with other people they like. That is when they are happiest… loneliness, regardless of how rich you are, is a very bad thing." A further point from his co-author Dr. Deaton argues “Not having enough money to live a decent life really gets in the way of doing the ordinary things that make people happy. What might create your emotional wellbeing is spending time with your friends, and if your income is below $75,000, you may not have the money to do it."
                    <br /><br />However, this does not mean the more affluent aren't stressed. The GHWBI data show that more educated and affluent individuals are often experience more stressed, with stress levels notably generally higher in wealthy countries. The data show that money doesn't alleviate stress in the same way it alleviates unhappiness. The financial pressures of maintaining our living standards and meeting our life achievement expectations keep us on our toes, not to mention having to keep up with the Joneses.

                <h2>2.1.5 Known drivers of retirement success</h2>
                <p>
                    As for wellbeing, there are multiple key interdependent elements for a successful retirement. Money becomes but a means to an end. It provides control and it reduces stress. We need to feel in control and be able to look forward to the future. We need to plan and live accordingly. Planning for expectation management, planning for connection, planning for purpose and meaning, and planning for the capability to retain control of our lives as best we can.
                    <br /><br />While objective life circumstances play critical roles, most key elements are more about how you feel than what you have or what has happened to you. These elements are interdependent and look different to everyone but still form the key pillars required for a truly happy and fulfilled retirement.
                    <br /><br /><b>Wealth</b> – We cannot escape the objective reality that wealth in retirement provides a greater sense of control and can secure a more comfortable good life. Financial wellbeing feeds into other elements such as health, relationships, self-identity and social opportunities. We need enough financial freedom to meet our wellbeing needs.
                    <br /><br /><b>Wellbeing</b> – Physical and psychological health are a key influence on our happiness in retirement. This includes the level of stress we experience, including lifestyle aspirations, finances and debt. Having appropriate health funding can also considerably reduce stress and encourage preventative health measures. However, health issues become somewhat inevitable the older we become so it’s not just about your experience of poor health but how well you cope with these challenges. Embracing the resiliency to face and cope with inevitable changes ahead in our lives as we get older makes us more likely to succeed in retirement.
                    <br /><br />Retirees who look forward to the future live longer and happier. There is also evidence that shows that retirees with this mindset are much less impacted by pain, disappointment and loss than their more pessimistic counterparts. Their perspective changes their experience and foster their ability to cope with inevitable changes.
                    <br /><br /><b>Expectation alignment and acceptance</b> – Happiness is often defined as reality minus expectations. So much of our experience of a good life depends on comparisons – with our social environment, with what we think we ‘deserve’ and with what we have come to expect. When expectations do not align with reality the acceptance process is much harder. However, many retirees, especially at the modest end of the wealth scale, are able (or forced) to post rationalise where they have landed and make the best out of their circumstances. It can be extremely painful to have to admit you are not happy with where your life has led to and that you are left wanting. This kind of cognitive dissonance adaption may mask the fact that many retirees have had to make more of a compromise to the quality of life than they would really like.
                    <br /><br /><b>Control and certainty</b> – The sense of feeling in control in your retirement is both a great source of joy and conversely in its absence a potential source for stress and misery. Regardless of circumstances retirees will always be fundamentally happier when they feel in control and not plagued by uncertainties about the future. They need the financial confidence to be able to enjoy their life today while still looking forward to be able to enjoy it tomorrow.
                    <br /><br /><b>Connection</b> – This is a central pillar for happiness, especially the day to day emotional experience of your life. Relationships and quality connection, whether they be with partners, family, friends, colleague, communities or even a higher power are fundamental to our wellbeing. You can have health, wealth and success, but few people rate their wellbeing highly without this. The most comprehensive study of happiness conducted by Harvard happiness for over 75 years has some very clear conclusions - good relationships keep us happy and healthy. It’s the quality of close relationships rather than the quantity. It often about coping too – those in good relationships report less impact on happiness when experiencing pain, sickness or loss. Those who are lonely amplify their physical pain with emotional pain.
                    <br /><br /><b>Mental engagement</b> – Many happy retirees report continued learning endeavours, hobbies, passions and engagement with work and the broader world that keeps them intellectually stimulated. This is a key symptom for retirement success but possibly the real take away here is the avoidance of boredom. It doesn’t really matter what engages you, just don’t get bored.  Boredom will kill you. Many retirees report struggling with what to do with all the extra time on their hands post work and had not planned realistically for this.
                    <br /><br /><b>Purpose, identity and legacy</b> – As our motivational needs move up Maslow’s hierarchy beyond security, comfort and connection we find the need for maintaining our self-esteem. Our personal narrative needs purpose beyond just getting by and avoiding discomfort. Our inner story also craves continuity – a happy ending where we are in control and don’t lose what we already have. We want to maintain our self-identity despite the changes we face in societal and family roles as we get older – are we still needed and valued? We also tend to struggle with the concept of finality so we also find solace in the ‘legacy’ we leave behind – whether financial for family, enduring contribution to community or just how we hope our lives will be remembered by others. Those retirees who are able to fulfil these needs for meaning and come to peace with their final destination are much more likely to enjoy the last leg of the ride.

                <h2>2.2 Making complex decisions under uncertainty</h2>
                <p>
                    While we tend to assume our choice preferences will be rational to maximise utility, it has been well established that we don’t always make decisions with perfect information or rationality – particularly when they are complex and involve some future uncertainty.  We acquire and process information using a limited number of intuitive heuristic rules that help us reduce the complexity of the ‘problems’ (i.e. the best choice to make) and the effort it takes to solve them. We ignore pieces of information or relegate their importance. These heuristics are essential decision-making tools and ‘less is more’ can often prove effective in some contexts.
                    <br /><br />Beyond ‘rule of thumb’ decision making strategies and other cognitive biases in the way we process information (e.g. availability, anchoring, mental accounting, probability/big number biases and hyperbolic discounting), there are also many emotional biases that can influence our decision-making processes. We all experience these to some degree and many revolve around our natural aversion to ‘losing what we have’ and avoiding uncertainty in the future (e.g. loss aversion, ambiguity aversion, status quo bias, endowment/disposition effects, and regret aversion). Others reflect our tendency to lack self-control or overestimate our own abilities.
                    <br /><br />In summary, we know that all humans consistently depart from rationality under conditions of uncertainty e.g. financial decisions about the future which involve risk and uncertainty. We don’t have perfect information (or the ability to process it all effectively) and we tend to fall back on heuristics (short cuts and rule of thumb in our ‘good enough’ assessments to reduce cognitive effort). We find our decision making heavily influenced by our emotional motivations, biases and need to maintain self-esteem.

    ============================ -->
            <section id="2_21">
                <h2>2.2.1 Homo Heuristicus – The path of least resistance </h2>
                <p>
                    Traditional conceptions of human decision making as perfectly rational (‘homo economicus’) have been replaced with more evidence based behavioural finance explanations that are more akin to ‘homo heuristicus’ i.e. using short cuts to make decisions with rules of thumb and discounting pieces of complicated information. At the heart of this is our strong desire to make complex decisions easier - without really having to do all the math and consider every single possible option available in detail.
                    <br /><br /><b>Choice paradox</b> – While greater range of choice implies the potential to make better decisions for the individual this does not always turn out to be the case. We are much more comfortable with bounded rationality in our decisions and paradoxically more choice does not leave us any happier or able to make the right choice of or ourselves. This is because option paralysis typically leads to avoidance behaviours. We are also typically less happy about decisions with many options because we build expectation of making the perfect choice which can leave us disappointed and post decision the perceived opportunity cost can erode our satisfaction. People want to feel good about the decisions they make and commit too - often even post rationalising their choices to reduce buyers regret.
                    <br /><br />This suggests that simply providing more product options and more information in itself does not in fact help make better choices.
                    <br /><br />One real world experiment amply demonstrates these principles. A large corporate employer in the USA sought to increase the voluntary pension saving participation of its employees by matching their contributions and offering a wide range of investment options. When the uptake was more disappointing than expected they tried a simple experiment - they varied the number of investment options offered to employees. They found that for each investment option they removed, uptake in the program significantly increased. They also found that more options led to a desire to simplify the decision, skewing choice to perceived ‘sure bets’ even though not always less risky. More choice did not lead to better outcomes - in fact demonstrably the opposite.
                    <br /><br /><b>Naïve diversification heuristics and the 1/n success rule</b> – Depending on how our choices are framed we tend to prefer to hedge our bets and choose the ‘middle’ rather than relatively ‘extreme’ option. Where a pension versus lump sum decision is presented along a continuum from 100% lump sum to 100 pension, we will hedge our bets and choose a combination; a middle ground.
                    <br /><br />Another reputable real world study was conducted on academics in the USA could choose allocation between two funds with varying risk as part of their pension plans. Most chose to allocate their contributions 50:50 between the two choices.
                    <br /><br /><b>Hyperbolic discounting</b> – This is an extremely pervasive influence on all out thinking which essentially sees more value assigned to immediacy of reward. In essence a dollar today is worth more than 2 dollars tomorrow. This means we tend to favour options that reward us sooner rather than later with obvious influences on our decision making around spending and saving. We value certainty more and what we can more easily imagine enjoying. In the context of the lump sum decision, the more immediate certain reward is considerably more appealing than a future one.
                    <br /><br /><b>Probability and big number biases</b> – In short most of us are pretty bad at math and prefer to avoid thinking about complex numbers. We really struggle with understanding probabilities so for all the aforementioned reasons above we avoid the option we perceive as more probabilistic e.g. the actuarial calculated advantages and risks of life time pension payments over a more straight forward lump sum proposition.
                    <br /><br />We also assess each dollar’s value differently depending on the scale of relative comparisons. We might be less likely to take additional effort to save $25 dollars on a $1500 item than a $50 item – we compare the trade-off relative to the decision at stake. This also means that when big dollar sums are involved the differences of otherwise significant dollar amounts between the choices may be given less weighting relative to other trade-offs than they otherwise would.
                    <br /><br /><b>Wisdom of the default</b> - Many individuals use a fairly reasonable heuristic to put their faith in the wisdom of the default. This is particularly evident within public sector, industry fund or employer schemes where there is some sense of paternal trust that the best (or at least all round good enough) option will be provided to them by default. This obviously contributes to the influence of option framing in lump sum versus lifetime payment trade-offs.
                    <br /><br /><b>Mental accounting</b> - Mental accounting occurs when sums of money are treated and valued differently depending on where they came from and/or where they are kept. People also have separate mental accounts for different categories of spending and are reluctant to transfer spending from one account to another (Thaler, 1999).
                    <br /><br />Personal mental accounting buckets and spending expectations that have been formed over time are very influential in how retirement income decision commitments are made and how options are valued. Individuals often feel a strong need to feel in control of these financial buckets and may play a part in typical preferences for lump sum access.
